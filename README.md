# 🧠 Water Potability Prediction System
<p align="justify">
This project uses <strong>deep learning and machine learning</strong> models to predict whether water is <strong>safe (potable)</strong> for drinking based on physicochemical parameters. It supports <strong>Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6)</strong> – Clean Water and Sanitation – by enabling low-cost, scalable, and automated water quality assessment. The system includes a <strong>Gradio web application</strong> and <strong>Google Gemini AI</strong> integration for real-time intelligent insights.
</p>

# 📊 Problem Statement
<p align="justify">
Traditional water quality testing is expensive, manual, and inaccessible in rural or resource-limited regions. This project aims to <strong>automate water potability prediction</strong> using open datasets and AI techniques to enable <strong>rapid, affordable decision-making</strong> for safe water consumption.
